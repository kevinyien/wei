# wei

This is wei — a simple app for spontaneous connection. 

It doesn't do much. 

Add people and it will remind you to reach out at a random time every week. After you contact someone (outside the app), tap their name to send them to the bottom of the list. That's it. 

The name `wei` is an homage to the way people answer the phone in Chinese culture. I hope these simple reminders help you stay connected with the people you care about.
